#Bookmarklets
Bookmarklets are unobtrusive JavaScripts stored as the URL of a bookmark in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page [see wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet).


On a simpler tone, we can run javascript code directly in the address bar of our browser.
##First Way - directly typing into address bar
```
javascript:(function(){alert('hello anuj !!');})()
```
The result would be a dialogue box saying hello anuj !!.

But this method is very cumbersome as typing complex javascript codes in a single line can be very tediuos and can lead to errors.
